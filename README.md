# Week4Monday Day's work to practice constructors, prototype in OO
## Description
##### This takes in four  values being country, city, landMark and comments about my various visits and stores them as an object that can have an added action on it.
## Setup
##### Just input country, city, landMark and comments at the prompt and it'll store the values as an object.
##### Because of the lack of work **output** could not be modified to play back the object when given Id.

## Clarification
##### This project is complete in a sense that it can accept the values and store them in the object with key and id but output needs to be modified a little.
